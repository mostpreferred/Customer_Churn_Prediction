# Customer_Churn_Prediction
This repository contains code for building and evaluating machine learning models to predict customer churn. The goal is to identify customers at risk of leaving to implement retention strategies.

Dataset
1.  CustomerID: A unique identifier assigned to each telecom customer, enabling tracking and identification of individual customers.

2. Gender: The gender of the customer, which can be categorized as male, or female. This information helps in analyzing gender-based trends in
customer churn.

3. SeniorCitizen: A binary indicator that identifies whether the customer is a senior citizen or not. This attribute helps in understanding if there are any specific
churn patterns among senior customers.

4. Partner: Indicates whether the customer has a partner or not. This attribute helps in evaluating the impact of having a partner on churn behavior.
5. Dependents: Indicates whether the customer has dependents or not. This attribute helps in assessing the influence of having dependents on customer
churn.

6. Tenure: The duration for which the customer has been subscribed to the telecom service. It represents the loyalty or longevity of the customerâ€™s
relationship with the company and is a significant predictor of churn.
7. PhoneService: Indicates whether the customer has a phone service or not. This attribute helps in understanding the impact of phone service on churn.]
8. MultipleLines: Indicates whether the customer has multiple lines or not. This attribute helps in analyzing the effect of having multiple lines on customer churn.

9. InternetService: Indicates the type of internet service subscribed by the customer, such as DSL, fiber optic, or no internet service. It helps in evaluating the relationship between internet service and churn.

10. OnlineSecurity: Indicates whether the customer has online security services or not. This attribute helps in analyzing the impact of online security on customer churn.

11. OnlineBackup: Indicates whether the customer has online backup services or not. This attribute helps in evaluating the impact of online backup on churn behavior.

12. DeviceProtection: Indicates whether the customer has device protection services or not. This attribute helps in understanding the influence of device protection on churn.

13. TechSupport: Indicates whether the customer has technical support services or not. This attribute helps in assessing the impact of tech support on churn behavior.

14. StreamingTV: Indicates whether the customer has streaming TV services or not. This attribute helps in evaluating the impact of streaming TV on customer churn.
15. StreamingMovies: Indicates whether the customer has streaming movie services or not. This attribute helps in understanding the influence of streaming movies on churn behavior.

16. Contract: Indicates the type of contract the customer has, such as a month-to-month, one-year, or two-year contract. It is a crucial factor in predicting churn as different contract lengths may have varying impacts on customer loyalty.

17. PaperlessBilling: Indicates whether the customer has opted for paperless billing or not. This attribute helps in analyzing the effect of paperless billing on customer churn.

18. PaymentMethod: Indicates the method of payment used by the customer, such as electronic checks, mailed checks, bank transfers, or credit cards. This attribute helps in evaluating the impact of payment methods on churn.

19. MonthlyCharges: The amount charged to the customer on a monthly basis. It helps in understanding the relationship between monthly charges and churn behavior.

20. TotalCharges: The total amount charged to the customer over the entire tenure. It represents the cumulative revenue generated from the customer and may have an impact on churn.

21. Churn: The target variable indicates whether the customer has churned (canceled the service) or not. It is the main variable to predict in telecom customer churn analysis.

Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization steps are included.
Model Development
Algorithms:  machine learning algorithms used, e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SGD, DECISION TREE.
Evaluation Metrics: The evaluation metrics used, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC.
